### Java - Simple Shell Interface by johnTzan

Small Project I did for school. Exercise is out of Operating Systems Concepts with Java by Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne. 

A simple shell interface with some basic command functionality that includes:
- cat
- ls
- cd
- history

##### How to run it:
Clone or download repository. From command line, change directory to folder where downloaded and run the following:
- javac SimpleShell.java
- java SimpleShell

After these commands the java shell will take over the terminal. Ctrl-C to exit out.
